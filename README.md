# pydalgo
Data structures and algorithm library in Python

What is PyDalgo ?

Our Aim is to create a Python library which will help in implementation of data structures and algorithms. This will be published as a PYPI package. 

## Data Structures to be implemented

1. Linear Data structures : Array, linked list, stack, queue
2. Non linear data structures : Tree, Graph 

## Algorithms

1. Recursive algorithm
2. Dynamic Programming
3. Backtracking
4. Divide and Conquer
5. Greedy
6. Brute Force 
7. Randomized

Every type of algorithm should have a different module.
